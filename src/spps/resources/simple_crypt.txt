-CreatePrivateKey
    Creates a settings file with a new generated private key.
    Important Note: Usually you do not need to execute this command unless you want to create a new private key.
    Remember, secrets already encrypted with the old key cannot be decrypted with the new key!

-File <file>
    Set an alternative setting file.

-Force
    Use this parameter in case when a private key file already exists. With this parameter you agree to overwrite it.
    Works only together with option "-CreatePrivateKey"

-Relocation <file>
    Use this parameter to persist the private key at another location instead of the default '.spps' folder of the
    current users home. iThe default settings file points to the other settings file.
    Works only together with option "-CreatePrivateKey"

-Secret <secret>
    Creates and print an encrypted.
    If the private key does not exist, it will be created automatically when you encrypt the first secret!
